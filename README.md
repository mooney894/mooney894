# Projects

### Guess the word game.

## Project Purpose
The purpose of the project is to create a word guessing game where the player attempts to guess a word by inputting letters or the entire word. The game provides hints for each word to aid the player in their guessing.

## Key features
1. Random word selection: The game selects a random word from a list of words.
2. Hidden word representation: The selected word is initially represented by asterisks, and the player's correct guesses are gradually revealed.
3. Hints: Each word in the game has a corresponding hint, which is displayed to the player.
4. Limited attempts: The player has a specific number of attempts (lives) to guess the word correctly.
5. Incorrect guesses tracking: The game keeps track of the player's incorrect guesses and displays them.
6. Game over conditions: The game ends when the player either guesses the word correctly or runs out of lives.

## Technologies Used
The code is written in Python. It utilizes the random module to choose a random word from a list. The words, hints, and incorrect guesses are read from text files. The game logic is implemented using loops, conditionals, and string operations.

Overall, the project provides an interactive word guessing game that challenges players to deduce words based on hints and limited attempts.
